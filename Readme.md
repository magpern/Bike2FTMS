## **Project Overview**
This project implements an **ANT+ to BLE bridge** using an **nRF52840** microcontroller. The bridge listens for **ANT+ spin bike data** (device type 11), processes it, and transmits it using the **BLE FTMS (Fitness Machine Service)** protocol. This allows BLE-enabled fitness applications to receive real-time cycling data.

The firmware is optimized for **low-power operation**, implementing sleep modes and event-driven ANT+ scanning to ensure efficiency.

## **Features**
### ‚úÖ **Implemented Features**
- **BLE FTMS Support**
  - Implements FTMS characteristics for cycling power, cadence, and training status.
  - Supports **Indoor Bike Data (0x2AD2)**, **Training Status (0x2AD3)**, and **Fitness Machine Status (0x2ADA)**.
- **ANT+ Bicycle Power Profile (Device Type 11)**
  - Listens for ANT+ power meter broadcasts.
  - Parses power, cadence, and additional data.
- **Device Configuration via BLE**
  - Allows setting the **ANT+ Device ID** and **BLE name** dynamically.
  - Settings persist across reboots using **UICR flash storage**.
- **NFC Support for Quick Setup**
  - Scans NFC tags to configure **ANT+ Device ID and BLE name**.
    (Implemented, but not active)
- **Power Management Features**
  - BLE advertising starts **only when ANT+ data is detected**.
  - Automatically **enters deep sleep** when no ANT+ devices are broadcasting.
  - Implements **wake-up on ANT+ signal detection**.

---

## **System Workflow**
1. The **nRF52840 wakes up** and starts scanning for ANT+ broadcasts.
2. If a valid **ANT+ spin bike** is found:
   - BLE advertising starts.
   - FTMS notifications begin transmitting cycling data.
3. If no ANT+ data is detected for **10 seconds**:
   - BLE advertising stops.
   - The device enters **deep sleep**.
4. The device **periodically wakes up** to check for new ANT+ broadcasts.
